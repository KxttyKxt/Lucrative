# Lucrative - RPG Looting and Conquering ~ ðŸ’Žâœ¨
##### (`Lucrative`)
GitHub Repo for my [CurseForge modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/lucrative) of the same name. Used for version control and cloud sync.

Commits pushed to `main` should also be logged in the [changelog document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfyX-cWdZkWtWKBZpo2ZQqECP3kd-3kbRFM_24hmZBo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Cloning the Repository
This repository reflects files I edit directly within the CurseForge modpack instance. As such, I recommend cloning it to the default location of your CurseForge modpacks.
However, it's not that simple. This repository does not include some vital files necessary for CurseForge to recognize your instance. Adding a blank `minecraftinstance.json` file should be enough to make it show up in CurseForge. From there, open the pack, click the three dots in the top right, and select "Repair Profile." Then you should be good to go.
